# CLAUDE.md

This file is the project entry point for Claude Code.

**You MUST read [`./SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) before any PPT generation task or repo modification.** This repository exists to generate presentations; SKILL.md is the authoritative workflow that owns project creation, role switching, serial execution, quality gates, post-processing, export, and every per-step command. The rest of this file only points to where related material lives — it never substitutes for SKILL.md.

## Project Overview

PPT Master is an AI-driven presentation generation system. Multi-role collaboration (Strategist → Image_Generator → Executor) converts source documents (PDF/DOCX/URL/Markdown) into natively editable PPTX with real PowerPoint shapes (DrawingML).

**Core Pipeline**: `Source Document → Create Project → [Template] → Strategist Eight Confirmations → [Image_Generator] → Executor Live Preview → Quality Check → Post-processing → Export PPTX`

> Topic-only requests with no source material: run the standalone [`topic-research`](./workflows/topic-research.md) workflow before SKILL.md Step 1 to gather web materials.
>
> Phase B resumption (split-mode execution): when the user opens a fresh chat and says "继续生成 projects/<x>" or similar, run the standalone [`resume-execute`](./workflows/resume-execute.md) workflow to enter Phase B (SVG generation + export) without re-running Phase A.
>
> Decks containing data charts: run the standalone [`verify-charts`](./workflows/verify-charts.md) workflow between the executor and post-processing steps to calibrate chart coordinates.
>
> Recorded narration / video export: run the standalone [`generate-audio`](./workflows/generate-audio.md) workflow after post-processing.
>
> Object-level animation tuning: when the user asks to change animation order, effect, timing, or a specific object's reveal behavior, run the standalone [`customize-animations`](./workflows/customize-animations.md) workflow. Default export already has global animations; do not create `animations.json` unless customization was requested.
>
> Live preview: any time the user mentions "live preview", "preview", "看效果", or wants to click/select a slide element, run [`live-preview`](./workflows/live-preview.md). Step 6 auto-starts it during generation; the workflow covers post-export re-entry and applying submitted annotations.
>
> Brand identity setup: when the user asks to "set up brand" / "建立品牌" / "做品牌规范", provides a brand asset (logo / brand site URL / branded PPTX / brand PDF), or wants to extract a brand from existing materials, run the standalone [`create-brand`](./workflows/create-brand.md) workflow. Output goes to `./templates/brands/<id>/`. Brands apply at SKILL.md Step 3 via the same explicit-path rule as layout templates — the user supplies the brand directory path to apply it; bare brand names never trigger.
>
> Visual self-check: only when the user explicitly requests a per-page visual review on the generated SVGs (e.g., "跑一下视觉自检 / 视觉回看 / 视觉 rubric", "visual review", "check each page visually"), run the standalone [`visual-review`](./workflows/visual-review.md) workflow between the executor and post-processing steps. The main pipeline does NOT invoke it automatically; do not infer or recommend it from deck size, model identity, or any other signal — user request is the only trigger.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Root requirements.txt delegates to ./requirements.txt
```

The scripts directory is **not a Python package** — it's a flat directory of scripts. Entry-point scripts that need sibling imports inject `scripts/` onto `sys.path` themselves (`sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent))`). Post-injection imports are annotated with `# noqa: E402`.

**API keys** for image generation/search/TTS go in `.env`. Discovery order: current working directory → clone repo root → `~/.ppt-master/.env`. Copy `.env.example` to get started; skill marketplace installs should use `mkdir -p ~/.ppt-master && cp .env.example ~/.ppt-master/.env` for a persistent config.

## Execution Requirements

- For standalone template creation (no source deck), read [`./workflows/create-template.md`](./workflows/create-template.md).
- Technical SVG/PPT constraints live in [`./references/shared-standards.md`](./references/shared-standards.md).
- Canvas choices live in [`./references/canvas-formats.md`](./references/canvas-formats.md).
- Icon library details live in [`./templates/icons/README.md`](./templates/icons/README.md).
- **No automated tests** — this repo deliberately ships no `tests/` directories, `test_*.py` files, or test frameworks. Verify changes with inline smoke commands against real project samples or manual verification steps.

## Required Conventions

- **Repo-wide style rules** — when editing prompt files under [`./references/`](./references/), Python under [`./scripts/`](./scripts/), or any other code/prose in the repo, follow the matching style rule in [`./docs/rules/`](./docs/rules/).
- **Markdown language consistency** — Markdown files under `./workflows/`, `./references/`, and `./docs/` are currently single-language per directory. New files mirror the language of their siblings; do not mix English scaffolding with Chinese paragraphs (or vice versa) inside one file. Chat replies are unaffected.

## Compatibility Boundary

- This repository is a workflow/skill package, not an app or service scaffold.
- Do NOT assume generic-project conventions like `.worktrees/`, `tests/`, or mandatory branch setup unless the user explicitly requests them.
- On conflict with a generic coding skill, prioritize [`./SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) inside this repository.

## Command Quick Reference
